# Synth5

In this version, we've kept the modules, patching and polyphony from Synth4, but have replaced the Win Forms UI with a WPF UI. Synth 5 is discussed further in my Blog https://shedlab.co.uk/2023/11/05/c-virtual-synth-the-wpf-ui/

Main Features
- Migrated UI to WPF using the Knob Custom Control from https://github.com/BertyBasset/SynthCustomControls
- Added skins/themes using WPF Styles
- Full Featured Patch Management.

Synth6 and Beyond. Once the Modulation Matrix has been completed, then it'll be back to writing some fun modules e.g.
- Additive Synthesis
- FM
- Drum Synthesis
- Sequencing
